<h1>C5.0 Tree</h1>
<p>This procedure estimates a classification tree model
using the C5.0 algorithm. The output can be a tree or
a set of rules.  Missing data can be handled within the
process.  The procedure can also do predictions
for the estimation data or a new dataset using a saved
model.  Boosting can be performed for increased accuracy.
</p>
<p>When predicting on new data, the model specification is taken from
    a previous estimated model.  Do not enter model parameters in
    that mode.  The Options and Costs subdialogs are only used
    for estimation.  The Save and Output subdialogs have settings that
    apply to both modes.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Model Source</span> Choose whether to
estimate a model or to make predictions using a previously estimated
model.  A dataset name for the output must be specified in the Save subdialog if
making predictions.<p>
<p>
</p>Specify the file containing the saved model workspace if predicting from
a model file.  If using the retained workspace, the Save subdialog must
have specified that the workspace should be retained, and no other R-based
procedure may have been run since the model was estimated.  Only the most
recently estimated model in the workspace is available for use in prediction
</p>
<p>Split files and the Statistics case weights are not supported by this procedure.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Dependent</span> Select the
dependent variable, which must be categorical.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Independent</span> Specify
the independent variables.  Categorical variables will
be automatically treated as ordered or unordered factors
according to the variable measurement levels.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Case ID</span>
Predictions are saved to a new dataset.
Optionally specify a case ID variable, which will be named ID, to be included in the new dataset.
</p>


<p><span class="runinhead">Influence</span> This procedure
does not use the Statistics case weight, but you can specify
an influence or importance weight. The relative weight is the
ratio of the weight to the average weight.  Missing or negative
weights are given a weight of 1.  Influence weights are likely
to be helpful for prediction only if cases with similar weights also
have similar values of the independent variables.
</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p><span class="runinhead">Cases with Missing Values</span> 
Choose whether to include or omit such cases.  The tree building
algorithm is capable of handling missing values appropriately.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">User Missing Values Treatment</span>
Choose whether to treat user-missing values as valid values or
as missing.  For scale variables, treating as valid would not make
sense, but for categorical variables with multiple user missing codes,
treating the values as valid would preserve the distinction.
With a mixture of predictor variable types, it may be approriate
to convert scale variable user missing values to system missing if
using the Valid option, since system-missing values are always
treated as missing.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Categorical Variables</span> Categorical
(nominal or ordinal) variables are automatically treated as factors.
The factor levels can be based on the actual values of these variables
or on the associated value labels.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Use feature selection</span>
The tree will be built using the most effective variables, so
some variables may not appear in the result.  When there are
many variables, prescreening them before building the tree
may be useful.  Check this box  to use this feature.
</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Number of boosting iterations</span>
Specify the number of boosting iterations with a value of
1 indicating a single model.
</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Confidence Factor</span>
Specify the confidence factor as a percentage.  It represents the
confidence with which a prediction is made, but if boosting is
used, it may not be the true accuracy of the rule.  If multiple
rules apply, the outcome is determined by confidence-weighted voting.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Minimum Size</span>
At each branch point in the tree, at least this number
of cases must follow at least two branches, however missing values
and unequal costs can modify this behavior.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Training Proportion</span>
A random sample containing the specified proportion of the cases is used to construct the classifier. Then the classifier is evaluated on a non-overlapping set of test cases consisting of another sample of the same size as the training set (if the proportion is less than half), or, otherwise, all the
non-training set cases.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Random Number Seed</span>
Specify a value if you want to be able to reproduce the exact
results with the same data in a future run.
</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p><span class="runinhead">Display tree or rules</span>
Check this box to display the tree or rule set.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Output Type</span>
The output can be displayed as a description of the tree or
as a set of rules. If rules are displayed, they can be
ordered by their effect on the error rate and grouped into
the number of bands specified.  The effect of each entire
group can be seen this way.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Display Variable Importance Table</span> 
The independent variable importance is determined by the percentage of
training set samples that fall into all the terminal nodes after the split
(usage).  That is, it is the percentage of cases where the classification
uses the variable at some point in the tree.  The splits column shows the percentage of splits that use each variable.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Display cost matrix</span> Check this
box to display the cost matrix.  If no cost matrix was specified,
i.e., all misclassifications have the same cost, no table is produced.
</p>

<h2>Save</h2>
<p><span class="runinhead">Prediction Dataset</span> 
Specify a dataset name that is not already in use to contain the
predicted values whether for the estimation data or for a new
dataset where predictions are made from a previously estimated model.
Predictions are made with the same level of boosting as was used
in estimation if possible.
</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Prediction Type</span> Predictions
can be of the most likely class or can show the predicted probability of each
class.  The probabilities are not available if a cost matrix was
specified.
</p>
<p><span class="runinhead">Workspace</span> The workspace containing
the estimated model can be saved in memory and can be written to a file.
Specify Retain if you want to make predictions from the model
using new data as a subsequent command in the same session.  Only the most recently
estimated model is available, and no other R-based code should
be run inbetween.
</p>
<p>You can save the workspace containing the model to a file
for later use.  Specify that file in the Model Source group
when making predictions for new data.
</p>

<h2>Costs</h2>
<p>The cost matrix specifies the misclassification cost for each pair
of predicted and true categories.  If no cost matrix is specified,
all misclassification costs are assumed to be equal.  The rows of the
matrix are the predicted categories, and the columns are the true
categories.  Each element of the matrix is represented as a triple
of the form
row category, column category, cost.  The diagonal elements, which
represent correct predictions, automatically have a cost of zero.
All categories must be accounted for.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a cost matrix.  It shows, for example,
that predicting category C when the true category is A has a
cost of 20.</p>
<table border="1">
<caption>A cost matrix</caption>
<tr><th>Predicted</th><th colspan="3">Actual</tr>
<tr><th></th><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th></tr>
<tr><th>A</th><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><tr>
<tr><th>B</th><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><tr>
<tr><th>C</th><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><tr>
</table>
<p>Enter the triples in the boxes below.  Multiple boxes are provided
to facilitate entry, but these do not correspond to the rows and columns
of the matrix.  Here is the specification for the example matrix.<br/>
<span class="code">
'A' 'B'=5  'A' 'C'=10 'B' 'A'=3 'B' 'C'=5 'C' 'A'=20 'C' 'B'=5
</span>
<p>String categories, as in this example, should be quoted.</p>
