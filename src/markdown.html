<p>This procedure does not use the Statistics WEIGHT variable (see below)
and does not support split files.</p>

<p>This command operates in two modes.  It can be used to estimate
a model, which is the default, or it can be used with a model previously estimated
and saved in memory or a file to make predictions for new data.</p>

<p><strong>MODE</strong> specifies whether to estimate a
model or use a previously estimated model to calculate predictions.  The choices are</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ESTIMATE</strong>: estimate a model (and optionally predict)</li>
<li><strong>PREDICT</strong>: predict using a previously estimated model
</ul>

<p><strong>USEWORKSPACE=YES</strong> indicates that a workspace
kept using WORKSPACEACTION=RETAIN is the source of the model.<br/>
<strong>WORKSPACEFILE</strong> specifies that the model source
is a previously created model that was saved
to a file with WORKSPACEFILE.
</p>

<p><strong>DEPENDENT</strong> specifies the dependent variable, which
must be categorical.</p>

<p><strong>INDEPENDENT</strong> specifies one or more independent variables
</p>
<p>DEPENDENT and INDEPENDENT are only used in estimate mode.  In predict
mode, the model variable specification is taken from the saved model.
</p>
<p><strong>ID</strong> optionally names a variable to identify
the cases if a prediction dataset is created.  In
PREDICT mode, the ID specification comes from that command instance.</p>
<p><strong>INFLUENCE</strong> optionally names an influence
or importance weight variable.  
The relative weight is the
ratio of the weight to the average weight.  Missing or negative
weights are given a weight of 1.  Influence weights are likely
to be helpful for prediction only if cases with similar weights also
have similar values of the independent variables.
</p>
<p>By default, all misclassifications are assumed to have the
same cost. <strong>COSTS</strong> can be used to specify
unequal costs.
The cost matrix specifies the misclassification cost for each pair
of predicted and true categories.  The rows of the
matrix are the predicted categories, and the columns are the true
categories.  Each element of the matrix is represented as a triple
of the form
row category, column category, cost.  The diagonal elements, which
represent correct predictions, automatically have a cost of zero.
All categories must be accounted for.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a cost matrix.  It shows, for example,
that predicting category C when the true category is A has a
cost of 20.</p>
<table border="1">
<caption>A cost matrix</caption>
<tr><th>Predicted</th><th colspan="3">Actual</tr>
<tr><th></th><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th></tr>
<tr><th>A</th><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><tr>
<tr><th>B</th><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><tr>
<tr><th>C</th><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><tr>
</table>
<p>Here is the specification for the example matrix.<br/>
<span class="code">
COSTS = 'A' 'B'=5  'A' 'C'=10 'B' 'A'=3 'B' 'C'=5 'C' 'A'=20 'C' 'B'=5
</span>
<p>String categories, as in this example, should be quoted.
The = are optional but improve readability of the syntax.</p>

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>MISSING</strong> Choose whether to include or omit cases with any missing values.  The tree building algorithm is capable of handling missing values appropriately.
</p>
<p><strong>USERMISSINGVALID</strong> Choose whether to treat user-missing values as valid values or
as missing.  For scale variables, treating as valid would not make
sense, but for categorical variables with multiple user missing codes,
treating the values as valid would preserve the distinction.
With a mixture of predictor variable types, it may be approriate
to convert scale variable user missing values to system missing if
using the valid option, since system-missing values are always
treated as missing.
</p>
<p><strong>FACTORCONVERSION</strong> Categorical
(nominal or ordinal) variables are automatically treated as factors.
The factor levels can be based on the actual values of these variables
or on the associated value labels.
</p>
<p><strong>BOOSTS</strong> specifies the number of boosting iterations with a value of 1, which is the default, indicating a single model.
</p>
<p><strong>GROUPING</strong> Indicates whether the model building
should evaluate groups of discrete predictors for splits.
</p>
<p><strong>FEATURESELECTION</strong> The tree will be built using the most effective variables, so some variables may not appear in the result.  
When there are 
many variables, prescreening them before building the tree
may be useful.
</p>
<p><strong>CONFIDENCE</strong> Specify the confidence factor as a percentage.  It represents the
confidence with which a prediction is made, but if boosting is
used, it may not be the true accuracy of the rule.  If multiple
rules apply, the outcome is determined by confidence-weighted voting.
The default value is 25%.
</p>
<p><strong>MINSIZE</strong> At each branch point in the tree, at least this number
of cases must follow at least two branches, however missing values
and unequal costs can modify this behavior.  The default value is 2.
</p>
<p><strong>TRAINPROP</strong> 
A random sample containing the specified proportion of the cases is used to construct the classifier. Then the classifier is evaluated on a non-overlapping set of test cases consisting of another sample of the same size as the training set (if the proportion is less than half), or, otherwise, all the
non-training set cases.  By default, all cases are used for training.
</p>
<p><strong>RNSEED</strong> 
Specify an integer value if you want to be able to reproduce the exact
results with the same data in a future run.
</p>
<h2>PRINT</h2>
<p><strong>TREE</strong>, <strong>COSTMATRIX</strong>, and <strong>VARIMPORTANCE</strong> specify whether these outputs are displayed.
</p>
<p><strong>RULES</strong> specifies whether the tree or the
equivalent set of classification rules should be displayed.
</p>
<p><strong>RULEBANDS</strong> If rules are displayed, they can be
ordered by their effect on the error rate and grouped into
the number of bands specified.  The effect of each entire
group can be seen this way.  The default is 1.
</p>

<h2>SAVE</h2>

<p><strong>DATASET</strong> specifies the output dataset name.  The name
must not already be in use.  Predictions can be made for the
estimation data in ESTIMATE mode and for new data in PREDICT mode.</p>

<p><strong>PREDTYPE</strong> specifies the type of prediction output.
Predictions
can be of the most likely class or can show the predicted probability of each
class.  The probabilities are not available if a cost matrix was
specified.
</p>

<p><strong>WORKSPACEACTION</strong> specifies whether to clear the
in-memory workspace after the procedure (CLEAR) or
to retain it for following prediction calculations.</p>

<p><strong>WORKSPACEOUTFILE</strong> specifies whether to save the
estimated model to a file.  It can be used in either ESTIMATE or
PREDICT mode.</p>
